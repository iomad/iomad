This files describes API changes in tagging, information provided
here is intended especially for developers.

=== 3.1 ===

* Each plugin must define the tag areas it uses in plugindir/db/tag.php
  See https://docs.moodle.org/dev/Tag_API for more details.
* When adding a 'tags' form element the component and itemtype must be specified
  in the element attributes.
* Tag name is no longer a unique field in 'tag' table, tags may be separated in
  tag collections
* Specifying component is also required when retrieving item tags. This will allow
  different components to add tags to the same table (for example blog and forum
  posts) and even suggest alternative tagging for the same items.
* All tag_* functions were deprecated because they now require either tag
  collection id or component, some were moved to the new class core_tag_tag and
  some - to the renderers or templates. As usual, the deprecated function code
  and debugging message will provide you with the suggestions of the alternative.
  Please note that all deprecated functions will be removed after several major releases.
