Compiling LESS
--------------

If you want to make changes to the .css generated from these .less files then you
need to use a less compiler to build your changes. The supported way to achieve this
is using grunt.

See https://docs.moodle.org/dev/Grunt for details of how to install grunt.

Once grunt is installed run the 'css' task:

 $ grunt css

And the css files will be compiled.
