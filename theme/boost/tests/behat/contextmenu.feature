      | fullname | shortname |
      | Course 1 | C1        |
    And the following "users" exist:

    And I log in as "teacher1"
    And I am on "Course 1" course homepage
    And I click on ".context-header-settings-menu [role=button]" "css_element"
    And I choose "Edit settings" in the open action menu
