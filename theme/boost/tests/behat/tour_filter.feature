Feature: Apply tour filters to a tour for Classic
  In order to give more directed tours
  As an administrator
  I need to create a user tour specific to theme Classic

  @javascript
  Scenario: Add a tour for theme Classic
    Given I log in as "admin"
    And I add a new user tour with:
      | Name                | First tour |
      | Description         | My first tour |
      | Apply to URL match  | /my/% |
      | Tour is enabled     | 1 |
      | Theme               | Classic |
    And I add steps to the "First tour" tour:
      | targettype                  | Title             | Content |
      | Display in middle of page   | Welcome           | Welcome to your personal learning space. We'd like to give you a quick tour to show you some of the areas you may find helpful |
    When I am on homepage
    Then I should not see "Welcome to your personal learning space. We'd like to give you a quick tour to show you some of the areas you may find helpful"
