// Capability definitions for the rss_client block.
//
// The capabilities are loaded into the database table when the block is
// installed or updated. Whenever the capability definitions are updated,
// the module version number should be bumped up.
//
// The system has four possible values for a capability:
// CAP_ALLOW, CAP_PREVENT, CAP_PROHIBIT, and inherit (not set).
//
//
// CAPABILITY NAMING CONVENTION
//
// It is important that capability names are unique. The naming convention
// for capabilities that are specific to modules and blocks is as follows:
//   [mod/block]/<plugin_name>:<capabilityname>
//
// component_name should be the same as the directory name of the mod or block.
//
// Core moodle capabilities are defined thus:
//    moodle/<capabilityclass>:<capabilityname>
//
// Examples: mod/forum:viewpost
//           block/recent_activity:view
//           moodle/site:deleteuser
//
// The variable name for the capability definitions array is $capabilities.
