    And I log in as "admin"
    And I am on "Course 1" course homepage
    # Enable averages
    And I navigate to "Setup > Course grade settings" in the course gradebook
    And I set the following fields to these values:

    And I press "Save changes"
    # Add a manual grade item
    And I navigate to "Setup > Gradebook setup" in the course gradebook
    And I press "Add grade item"
    And I set the following fields to these values:

    And I press "Save changes"
    # Give all student the same grade for the manual grade item
    And I navigate to "View > Grader report" in the course gradebook
    And I turn editing mode on
    And I give the grade "50.00" to the user "Student 1" for the grade item "Manual item 1"
    And I give the grade "50.00" to the user "Student 2" for the grade item "Manual item 1"
    And I give the grade "50.00" to the user "Student 3" for the grade item "Manual item 1"

  Scenario: Grade a grade item and ensure the results display correctly in the gradebook
    # Check the admin grade table
    And I navigate to "View > Grader report" in the course gradebook
    Then I should see "50.00" in the ".avg.r0.lastrow .c1" "css_element"
    Then I should see "50.00" in the ".avg.r0.lastrow .c2" "css_element"
    And I log out

    # Check the user grade table
    And I log in as "student1"
    And I am on "Course 1" course homepage
    And I navigate to "User report" in the course gradebook
    Then I should see "50.00" in the ".level2.column-grade" "css_element"
    Then I should see "50.00" in the ".level2.column-average" "css_element"
    And I log out
