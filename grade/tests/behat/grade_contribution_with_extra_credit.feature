  Scenario Outline: The contribution of extra credit items is normalised
    Given I navigate to "Setup > Gradebook setup" in the course gradebook
    When I set the following settings for grade item "Course 1":
      | Aggregation | <aggregation> |
    And I set the following settings for grade item "Manual item 2":
      | Extra credit | 1 |
    And I set the following settings for grade item "Manual item 3":
      | Extra credit | 1 |
    And I set the following settings for grade item "Manual item 4":
      | Extra credit | 1 |
    And I navigate to "View > User report" in the course gradebook
    And I set the field "Select all or one user" to "Student 1"
    Then the following should exist in the "user-grade" table:
      | Grade item    | Calculated weight | Grade  | Contribution to course total |
      | Manual item 1 | <m1w>             | 80.00  | <m1c>                        |
      | Manual item 2 | <m2w>             | 10.00  | <m2c>                        |
      | Manual item 3 | <m3w>             | 70.00  | <m3c>                        |
      | Manual item 4 | 0.00 %            | 90.00  | 0.00 %                       |

    Examples:
      | aggregation                         | m1w      | m1c   | m2w      | m2c   | m3w     | m3c   |
      | Natural                             | 100.00 % | 53.33 % | 66.67 %  | 6.67 % | 57.14 % | 40.00 % |
      | Simple weighted mean of grades      | 100.00 % | 53.33 % | 66.67 %  | 6.67 % | 57.14 % | 40.00 % |
      | Mean of grades (with extra credits) | 100.00 % | 53.33 % | 100.00 % | 10.00 % | 52.38 % | 36.67 % |
