Feature: Grade letters can be overridden
  In order to test the grade letters functionality
  As a teacher I override site defaults
  and alter the grade letters

  Background:
    Given the following "courses" exist:
      | fullname | shortname |
      | Course 1 | C1        |
    And the following "users" exist:
      | username | firstname | lastname | email            | idnumber |
      | teacher1 | Teacher   | 1        | teacher1@example.com | t1       |
    And the following "course enrolments" exist:
      | user     | course | role           |
      | teacher1 | C1     | editingteacher |
    And I log in as "teacher1"
    And I am on "Course 1" course homepage
    And I navigate to "Letters > Edit" in the course gradebook

  Scenario Outline: Grade letters can be completely overridden
    When I set the following fields to these values:
      | override               | 1    |
      | Grade letter 1         | <l1> |
      | gradeboundary1         | <b1> |
      | Grade letter 2         | <l2> |
      | gradeboundary2         | <b2> |
      | Grade letter 3         | <l3> |
      | gradeboundary3         | <b3> |
      | Grade letter 4         | <l4> |
      | gradeboundary4         | <b4> |
      | Grade letter 5         | <l5> |
      | gradeboundary5         | <b5> |
      | Grade letter 6         | <l6> |
      | gradeboundary6         | <b6> |
      | Grade letter 7         | <l7> |
      | gradeboundary7         | <b7> |
      | Grade letter 8         | <l8> |
      | gradeboundary8         | <b8> |
      | Grade letter 9         | <l9> |
      | gradeboundary9         | <b9> |
      | Grade letter 10        |      |
      | gradeboundary10        |      |
      | Grade letter 11        |      |
      | gradeboundary11        |      |
      | Grade letter 12        |      |
      | gradeboundary12        |      |
      | Grade letter 13        |      |
      | gradeboundary13        |      |
      | Grade letter 14        |      |
      | gradeboundary14        |      |
    And I press "Save changes"
    Then I should see "The default grade letters are currently overridden."
    And the following should exist in the "grade-letters-view" table:
      | Highest | Lowest | Letter    |
      | <high1> | <low1> | <letter1> |
      | <high2> | <low2> | <letter2> |
