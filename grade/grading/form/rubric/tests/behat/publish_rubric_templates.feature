    And I log in as "manager1"

    And I go to "Test assignment 1 name" advanced grading definition page
    And I set the following fields to these values:
      | Name | Assignment 1 rubric |
      | Description | Assignment 1 description |
    And I define the following rubric:
      | Criterion 1 | Level 11 | 11 | Level 12 | 12 |
      | Criterion 2 | Level 21 | 21 | Level 22 | 22 |
    And I press "Save rubric and make it ready"
    When I publish "Test assignment 1 name" grading form definition as a public template
    And I log out
    And I log in as "teacher1"
    And I am on "Course 1" course homepage
    And I set "Test assignment 2 name" activity to use "Assignment 1 rubric" grading form
    Then I should see "Advanced grading: Test assignment 2 name (Submissions)"
    And I should see "Criterion 1"
    And I should see "Assignment 1 description"
    And I go to "Test assignment 2 name" advanced grading definition page
    And I should see "Current rubric status"

    And I press "Cancel"

    # Trying to avoid pointing by id or name as the code internals may change.
    And "//table[@class='criteria']//textarea[text()='Criterion 1']" "xpath_element" should exist
    And I press "Cancel"
