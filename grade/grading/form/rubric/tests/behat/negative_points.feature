Feature: Rubrics can have levels with negative scores
  In order to use and refine rubrics to grade students
  As a teacher
  I need to be able to penalise for very wrong submissions

    When I log in as "teacher1"
    And I am on "Course 1" course homepage with editing mode on
    And I go to "Test assignment 1" advanced grading definition page
    And I set the following fields to these values:
      | Name | Assignment 1 rubric |
      | Description | Rubric test description |
    And I define the following rubric:
      | Criterion 1 | Did not try | -11 | Level 12 | 25 | Level 13 | 40 | Level 14  | 50  |
      | Criterion 2 | Very bad    | -20 | Level 22 | 25 | Level 23 | 30 |           |     |
      | Criterion 3 | Level 31    | 10  | Level 32 | 20 |          |    |           |     |
    And I press "Save rubric and make it ready"
    # Grading a student.
    And I go to "Student 1" "Test assignment 1" activity advanced grading page
    And I grade by filling the rubric with:
      | Criterion 1 | 25 |  |
      | Criterion 2 | 30 |  |
      | Criterion 3 | 10 |  |
    And I save the advanced grading form
    And I go to "Student 2" "Test assignment 1" activity advanced grading page
    And I grade by filling the rubric with:
      | Criterion 1 | 25 |  |
      | Criterion 2 | -20 |  |
      | Criterion 3 | 10 |  |
    And I save the advanced grading form

      | Criterion 1 | -11 |  |
      | Criterion 2 | -20 |  |
      | Criterion 3 | 10 |  |
    And I save the advanced grading form
    # Checking that the user grade is correct.
    And I should see "65.00" in the "student1@example.com" "table_row"
    And I should see "15.00" in the "student2@example.com" "table_row"
    And I should see "0.00" in the "student3@example.com" "table_row"
    And I should not see "-" in the "student3@example.com" "table_row"
    And I log out
