This files describes API changes in /grade/report/*,
information provided here is intended especially for developers.

=== 3.2 ===
* External function gradereport_user_external::get_grades_table now has an optional groupid parameter.
Is recommended to use this parameter in courses with separate groups or when the user requesting the report is in more than one group.

=== 2.9 ===
* Deprecating grade_report_grader:get_collapsing_icon.
* A new web service function gradereport_user_get_grades_table has been added which will allow external system to retrieve grade information ready to be formatted as a table similar to the gradebook user report one.

=== 2.8.2 ===
* gradereport_singleview::__construct doesn't need groupid parameter anymore, so it was renamed to $unused.

=== 2.6.5, 2.7.2 ===

* The callback function grade_report_*_profilereport now takes one more parameter $viewasuser. This parameter
  is set to true when the report must be viewed as the user whose grades are being displayed. For instance,
  when a mentor/parent is viewing the report, they should see the same grades, not more, not less. When the
  setting is set to false (default), the capability checks, visibility and access levels are using the
  currently logged in user.
