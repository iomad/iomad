Feature: Within the grader report, test that we can open our generic filter dropdown component
  In order to filter down the users on the page
  As a teacher
  I need to be able to see the filter and select a combination of parameters
  Background:
    Given the following "courses" exist:
      | fullname | shortname | category | groupmode |
      | Course 1 | C1        | 0        | 1         |
    And the following "users" exist:
      | username | firstname | lastname | email                | idnumber |
      | teacher1 | Teacher   | 1        | teacher1@example.com | t1       |
      | student1 | Student   | 1        | student1@example.com | s1       |
      | student2 | Dummy     | User     | student2@example.com | s2       |
      | student3 | User      | Example  | student3@example.com | s3       |
      | student4 | User      | Test     | student4@example.com | s4       |
      | student5 | Turtle    | Manatee  | student5@example.com | s5       |
    And the following "course enrolments" exist:

      | teacher1 | C1     | editingteacher |
      | student1 | C1     | student        |
      | student2 | C1     | student        |
      | student3 | C1     | student        |
      | student4 | C1     | student        |
      | student5 | C1     | student        |
    And the following "activities" exist:
      | activity | course | idnumber | name                |
      | assign   | C1     | a1       | Test assignment one |
    And I am on the "Course 1" "grades > Grader report > View" page logged in as "teacher1"

  Scenario: A teacher can open the filter component
    Given I should see "Filter by name"
    When I click on "Filter by name" "combobox"
    Then I should see "27" node occurrences of type "input" in the "First name" "core_grades > initials bar"
    And I should see "27" node occurrences of type "input" in the "Last name" "core_grades > initials bar"
    And "input[data-action=cancel]" "css_element" should exist
    And "input[data-action=save]" "css_element" should exist

  Scenario: A teacher can filter the grader report to limit users reported
    Given I click on "Filter by name" "combobox"
    And I wait until "input[data-action=save]" "css_element" exists
    When I select "D" in the "First name" "core_grades > initials bar"
    And I press "Apply"
    And I wait to be redirected
    # We should only have one user that matches the "D" first name
    Then the following should exist in the "user-grades" table:
      | -1-                |
      | Dummy User         |
    And the following should not exist in the "user-grades" table:

      | Student 1          |
      | User Example       |
      | User Test          |
      | Turtle Manatee     |

    # Test filtering on last name
    # Business logic: If all is selected, we will not show it i.e. First (D) and NOT First (D) Last (All)
    And I click on "First (D)" "combobox"
    And I select "All" in the "First name" "core_grades > initials bar"
    And I select "M" in the "Last name" "core_grades > initials bar"
    And I press "Apply"
    And I wait to be redirected
    # We should only have one user that matches the "T" first name
    And the following should exist in the "user-grades" table:
      | -1-                |
      | Turtle Manatee     |

      | User Example       |
      | User Test          |
      | Dummy User         |

    # Test filtering on first && last name
    And I click on "Last (M)" "combobox"
    And I select "U" in the "First name" "core_grades > initials bar"
    And I select "T" in the "Last name" "core_grades > initials bar"
    And I press "Apply"
    And I wait to be redirected

    When I select "T" in the "First name" "core_grades > initials bar"
    And I press "Apply"
    And I wait to be redirected
    Then I should see "First (T)"

    And I wait until "input[data-action=save]" "css_element" exists
    And I select "All" in the "First name" "core_grades > initials bar"
    And I press "Apply"
    And I wait to be redirected
    # Check if the name button indicates if a filter is active
    And I should see "Filter by name"
    And I should not see "First (T)"
