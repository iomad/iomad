Feature: We can bulk insert grades for students in a course
  As a teacher
  In order to quickly grade items
  I can bulk insert values for all or empty grades.

  Background:
    Given the following "courses" exist:
      | fullname | shortname | category |
      | Course 1 | C1 | 0 |
    And the following "users" exist:

      | student2 | Student | 2 | student1@example.com | s2 | holly |
      | student3 | Student | 3 | student1@example.com | s3 | anna |
      | student4 | Student | 4 | student1@example.com | s4 | zac |
    And the following "course enrolments" exist:

      | assign | C1 | a3 | Test assignment three | Submit something! |
