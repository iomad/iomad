Feature: Allow teachers to edit the default activity completion rules in a course.
  In order to set the activity completion defaults for new activities
  As a teacher
  I need to be able to edit the completion rules for a group of activities.

  # Given I am a teacher in a course with completion tracking enabled and activities present.
  # When I edit activity completion defaults for activity types.
  # Then the completion rule defaults should apply only to activities created from that point onwards.
