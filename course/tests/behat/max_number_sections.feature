Feature: The maximum number of weeks/topics in a course can be configured
  In order to set boundaries to courses size
  As a manager
  I need to limit the number of weeks/topics a course can have

  Background:
    Given the following "users" exist:
      | username | firstname | lastname | email |
      | manager1 | Manager | 1 | manager1@example.com |
    And the following "system role assigns" exist:
      | user | course | role |
      | manager1 | Acceptance test site | manager |
    And I log in as "admin"
    And I navigate to "Course default settings" node in "Site administration >  Courses"

  @javascript
  Scenario: The number of sections can be increased and the limits are applied to courses
    Given I set the field "Maximum number of sections" to "100"
    When I press "Save changes"
    Then the field "Maximum number of sections" matches value "100"
    And the "Number of sections" select box should contain "100"
    And I log out
    And I log in as "manager1"
    And I create a course with:
      | Course full name | New course fullname |
      | Course short name | New course shortname |
      | Number of sections | 90 |
      | Format | Topics format |
    And I follow "New course fullname"
    And I should see "Topic 90"

  @javascript
  Scenario: The number of sections can be reduced to 0 and the limits are applied to courses
    Given I set the field "Maximum number of sections" to "0"
    When I press "Save changes"
    Then the field "Maximum number of sections" matches value "0"
    And the "Number of sections" select box should contain "0"
    And the "Number of sections" select box should not contain "52"
    And I log out
    And I log in as "manager1"
    And I create a course with:
      | Course full name | New course fullname |
      | Course short name | New course shortname |
      | Number of sections | 0 |
      | Format | Topics format |
    And I follow "New course fullname"
    And I should not see "Topic 1"
