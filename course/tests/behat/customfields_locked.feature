Feature: Fields locked control where they are displayed
  In order to display custom fields on course listing
  As a manager
  I can change the visibility of the fields

      | name              | component   | area   | itemid |
      | Category for test | core_course | course | 0      |
    Given the following "users" exist:
      | username | firstname | lastname | email                |
      | teacher1 | Teacher   | 1        | teacher1@example.com |

    When I log in as "admin"
    And I navigate to "Courses > Course custom fields" in site administration

    And I click on "Short text" "link"
    And I set the following fields to these values:

      | Locked     | No         |
