This files describes API changes in /portfolio/ portfolio system,
information provided here is intended especially for developers.

=== 3.1 ===

* The following functions, previously used (exclusively) by upgrade steps are not available
  anymore because of the upgrade cleanup performed for this version. See MDL-51580 for more info:
    - portfolio_picasa_admin_upgrade_notification()
    - portfolio_googledocs_admin_upgrade_notification()
    - portfolio_boxnet_admin_upgrade_notification()

=== 2.4 ===

The set_callback_options function's third parameter has been changed from a file path
to the component name - see MDL-33791. However, if any existing code passes a file path
Moodle will attempt to obtain the component name from the file path provided. Also, the
callback class should be located in the module's locallib.php file.

Example of change:

This:

$button->set_callback_options('assignment_portfolio_caller', array('id' => $this->cm->id, 'fileid' => $file->get_id()), '/mod/assignment/locallib.php');

Now becomes:

$button->set_callback_options('assignment_portfolio_caller', array('id' => $this->cm->id, 'fileid' => $file->get_id()), 'mod_assignment');

=== 2.3 ===

required changes:
* The following methods must now be declared static for php5 compatibility:
    - admin_config_form
    - admin_config_validation
