 * This class keeps track of a group of questions that are being attempted,
 * and which state, and so on, each one is currently in.
 *
 * A quiz attempt or a lesson attempt could use an instance of this class to
 * keep track of all the questions in the attempt and process student submissions.
 * It is basically a collection of {@question_attempt} objects.
 *
 * The questions being attempted as part of this usage are identified by an integer
 * that is passed into many of the methods as $slot. ($question->id is not
 * used so that the same question can be used more than once in an attempt.)
 *
 * Normally, calling code should be able to do everything it needs to be calling
 * methods of this class. You should not normally need to get individual
 * {@question_attempt} objects and play around with their inner workind, in code
 * that it outside the quetsion engine.
 *
 * Instances of this class correspond to rows in the question_usages table.
