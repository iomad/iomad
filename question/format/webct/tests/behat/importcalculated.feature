  Scenario: import a WebCT calculated question
    When I navigate to "Import" node in "Course administration > Question bank"
    And I set the field "id_format_webct" to "1"
    And I upload "question/format/webct/tests/fixtures/sample_calculated_webct.txt" file to "Import" filemanager
    And I press "id_submitbutton"
    Then I should see "Parsing questions from import file."
    And I should see "Importing 1 questions from file"
    And I should see "Find the area in m2 of a square with sides of length {l} m."
    When I press "Continue"
    Then I should see "calculated: Square area"
