/**
 * Missing word question importer.
 *
 * This Moodle class provides all functions necessary to import and export
 * one-correct-answer multiple choice questions in this format:
 *
 *    As soon as we begin to explore our body parts as infants
 *    we become students of {=anatomy and physiology ~reflexology
 *    ~science ~experiment}, and in a sense we remain students for life.
 *
 * Each answer is separated with a tilde ~, and the correct answer is
 * prefixed with an equals sign =
 *
 * Percentage weights can be included by following the tilde with the
 * desired percent.  Comments can be included for each choice by following
 * the comment with a hash mark ("#") and the comment.  Example:
 *
 *    This is {=the best answer#comment on the best answer ~75%a good
 *    answer#comment on the good answer ~a wrong one#comment on the bad answer}
