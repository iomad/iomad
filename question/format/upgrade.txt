This files describes API changes for question import/export format plugins.

=== 2.3 ===

* This plugin type now supports cron in the standard way. If required, Create a
  lib.php file containing
function qformat_mypluginname_cron() {};

=== 2.1.5 / 2.2.3 / 2.3 ===

* The readquestions method used to take a second argument $context. However, at
  the point where this method was called, it was impossible to know what
  context the quetsions were going to be saved into, so the value could be
  wrong. Also, none of the standard question formats were using this argument,
  so it was removed. See MDL-32220.

=== 2.2 ===

* The plugin name used to be defined in a string called the same thing as the
format, with assoicated help strings, for example:

$string['aiken'] = 'Aiken format';
$string['aiken_help'] = 'This is a simple format ...';
$string['aiken_link'] = 'qformat/aiken';

This needs to be changed to use the standard string name pluginname, as for
other plugin types.

$string['pluginname'] = 'Aiken format';
$string['pluginname_help'] = 'This is a simple format ...';
$string['pluginname_link'] = 'qformat/aiken';
