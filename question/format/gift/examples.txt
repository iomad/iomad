::GIFT Control Characters::
Which of the following is NOT a control character for the GIFT import format? {
   ~ \~     # \~ is a control character.
   ~ \=     # \= is a control character.
   ~ \#     # \# is a control character.
   ~ \{     # \{ is a control character.
   ~ \}     # \} is a control character.
   = \\     # Correct! \\ (backslash) is not a control character. BUT,
              it is used to escape the control characters. So, to specify
              a literal backslash, you must escape it with a backslash
              (as shown in this example).
