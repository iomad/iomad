  @javascript @_bug_phantomjs
  Scenario: Preview a question using the mouse.
    When I click on "Preview" "link" in the "Drag onto image" "table_row"
    And I switch to "questionpreview" window
    # Increase window size and wait 2 seconds to ensure elements are placed properly by js.
    # Keep window large else drag will scroll the window to find element.
    And I change window size to "large"
    And I wait "2" seconds
    # Odd, but the <br>s go to nothing, not a space.
    And I drag "mountainbelt" to place "1" in the drag and drop onto image question
    And I drag "continentalshelf" to place "2" in the drag and drop onto image question
