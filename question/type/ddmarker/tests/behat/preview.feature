  Scenario: Preview a question using the mouse.
    When I click on "Preview" "link" in the "Drag markers" "table_row"
    And I switch to "questionpreview" window
    # Increase window size and wait 2 seconds to ensure elements are placed properly by js.
    # Keep window large else drag will scroll the window to find element.
    And I change window size to "large"
    And I wait "2" seconds
    # Odd, but the <br>s go to nothing, not a space.
    And I drag "OU" to "342,230" in the drag and drop markers question
    And I drag "Railway station" to "254,197" in the drag and drop markers question
    And I drag "Railway station,1" to "326,319" in the drag and drop markers question
    And I drag "Railway station,2" to "203,101" in the drag and drop markers question
    And I press "Submit and finish"
    Then the state of "Please place the markers on the map of Milton Keynes" question is shown as "Correct"
    And I should see "Mark 1.00 out of 1.00"
    And I switch to the main window
