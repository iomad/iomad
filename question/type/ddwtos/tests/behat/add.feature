  Scenario: Create a drag and drop into text question
    When I add a "Drag and drop into text" question filling the form with:
      | Question name             | Drag and drop into text 001   |
      | Question text             | The [[1]] [[2]] on the [[3]]. |
      | General feedback          | The cat sat on the mat.       |
      | id_choices_0_answer       | cat                           |
      | id_choices_1_answer       | sat                           |
      | id_choices_2_answer       | mat                           |

      | Hint 2                    | Second hint                   |
