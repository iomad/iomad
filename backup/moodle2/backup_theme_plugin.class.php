 * Base class for theme backup plugins.
 *
 * NOTE: When you back up a course, it runs backup for ALL themes - not just
 * the currently selected one.
 *
 * That means that if, for example, a course was once in theme A, and theme A
 * had some data settings, but it is then changed to theme B, the data settings
 * will still be included in the backup and restore. With the restored course,
 * if you ever change it back to theme A, the settings will be ready.
 *
 * It also means that other themes which are not the one set up for the course,
 * but might be seen by some users (eg user themes, session themes, mnet themes)
 * can store data.
 *
 * If this behaviour is not desired for a particular theme's data, the subclass
 * can call is_current_theme('myname') to check.
