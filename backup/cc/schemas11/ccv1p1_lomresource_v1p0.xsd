            -------------------------
            Author:         Colin Smythe
            Date:           31st  January, 2011
            Version:        1.1
            Status:         Final
            Description:    This is the IMS GLC Meta-data v1.3 binding of the IEEE LOMv1.0 for the 
                            Common Cartridge v1.1 Resource Metadata.  This is based on the LOM strict binding.
                            The core changes are:
                            a) General complexType removed;
                            b) LifeCycle complexType removed;
                            c) Metametadata complexType removed;
                            d) Technical complexType removed;
                            e) Rights complexType removed;
                            f) Annotation complexType removed;
                            g) Classification complexType removed;
                            h) The educational element is required at least once in the metadata instance;
                            i) For Educational the context is required once and intendedEndUserRole at least once;
                            j) All order is now imposed using sequence;
                            k) All vocabs are constrained as required for the context and intendedEndUserRole elements.

            History:        Version 1.0 - the first release of this profile for the CC Resource metadata;
                            Version 1.1 - the 'mentor' enumeration value is added and the 'school' enumeration value are added
