  Scenario: View random (last) entry in the global glossary
    When I log in as "admin"
    And I am on "Course 2" course homepage
    And I follow "Tips and Tricks"
    And I press "Add a new entry"
    And I set the following fields to these values:
      | Concept    | Never come late               |
      | Definition | Come in time for your classes |
    And I press "Save changes"

      | How a new entry is chosen       | Last modified entry |
    And I press "Save changes"
    Then I should see "Never come late" in the "Tip of the day" "block"
    And I should not see "Add a new entry" in the "Tip of the day" "block"
    And I should see "View all entries" in the "Tip of the day" "block"
    And I log out
    # Student who can't see the module is still able to view entries in this block (because the glossary was marked as global)
    And I log in as "student1"
    And I am on "Course 1" course homepage
    And I should see "Never come late" in the "Tip of the day" "block"
    And I should not see "Add a new entry" in the "Tip of the day" "block"
    And I should see "View all entries" in the "Tip of the day" "block"
    And I log out
