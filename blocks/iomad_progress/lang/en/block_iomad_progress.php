<p>There can be multiple instances of the Progress Bar block. You may use different Progress Bar blocks to monitor different sets of activities or resources.

<p>You may wish to add tick and cross icons in the Progress Bar to make this block more visually accessible for students with colour-blindness.</p>

<p>Not all course are focussed on completion of tasks by specific times. Some courses may have an open-enrolment, allowing students to enrol and complete when they can.</p>

<p>The purpose of this block is to encourage students to manage their time effectively. Each student can monitor their progress in completing the activities and resources you have created.</p>
<p>On the configuration page you will see a list of all the modules that you have created which can be monitored by the Progress Bar block. Modules will only be monitored and appear as a small square in the progress bar if you select Yes to monitor the module.</p>

<p>Where an activity can, in its own settings, have a deadline, and a deadline is set, it is optional to use the deadline of the activity, or to set another separate time used for the activity in the Progress Bar.</p>
<p>To lock the Progress Bar to an activity\'s deadline it must have a deadline enabled and set. If the deadline is locked, changing the deadline in the activity\'s settings will automatically change the time associated with the activity in the Progress Bar.</p>

<p>The <em>Expected by</em> date-time is when the related activity/resource is expected to be completed (viewed, submitted, posted-to, etc...).</p>
<p>If there is already a deadline associated with an activity, like an assignment deadline, this deadline can be used as the expected time for the event as long as the "Locked to Deadline" checkbox is checked. By deselecting locking an independent expected time can be created, and altering this will not affect the actual deadline of the activity.</p>
<p>When you first visit the configuration page for the Progress Bar, or if you create a new activity/resource and return to the configuration page, a guess will be made about the expected date-time for the activity/resource.
<ul>
    <li>For an activity with an existing deadline, this deadline will used.</li>
    <li>When there is no activity deadline, but the course format used is a weekly format, the end of the week (just before midnight Sunday) is assumed.</li>
    <li>For an activity/resource not used in a weekly course format, the end of the current week (just before midnight next Sunday) is used.</li>

For example, for assignments, submission can be monitored; quizzes can be monitored on attempt; forums can be monitored for student postings; choice activities can monitored for answering and viewing resources is monitored.</p>
<h3>Passing</h3>
<p>For the assignment, lesson and quiz modules, the notion of passing relies on a "Grade to pass" being set for the grade item in the Gradebook. <a href="http://docs.moodle.org/en/Grade_items#Activity-based_grade_items" target="_blank">More help...</a></p>
