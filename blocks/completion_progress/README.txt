The Completion Progress block is a time-management tool for students.
It visually shows what activities/resources a student is supposed to interact with in a course.
It is colour-coded so students can quickly see what they have and have not completed/viewed.
The block shows activities with activity completion settings.

To Install
1. Copy the completion_progress directory to the blocks/ directory of your Moodle instance

4. Add the Completion Progress block to your page

Hidden items will not appear in the Completion Progress block until they are visible to students.
This is useful for a scheduled release of activities.
