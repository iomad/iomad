/**
 * Abstraction layer to use to get the list of mergin actions to perform.
 *
 * For simplicity, we force to implement the Iterator interface.
 *
 * For complex gathering implementations, like obtaning the list from external databases,
 * loading CSV files, or command line scripts, you can initialize all the necessary stuff
 * in its constructor (__construct()). It is highly recommended to check all things are ok
 * in method rewind() to start the iteration.
