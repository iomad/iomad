/**
 * TableMerger to process quiz_attempts table.
 *
 * Quiz attempts are a complex entity in that they also span multiple tables into the question engine
 * and so, if both users have attempted a quiz, quiz_attempts and quiz_grades tables have to be updated
 * correspondingly.
 *
 *
 * There are 3 possible ways for quiz attempts to occur:
 *
 * 1.  The old user only attempts the quiz
 *      - In this case the quiz attempt is transferred over through the $recordsToModify array
 *      - Normal merging on compound index will process it naturally,
 *        using $toid to set the userid in the quiz grades table.
 * 2. The new user only attempts the quiz
 *      - In this case it won't matter, no processing is needed
 * 3. Both users attempt the quiz. There are 4 different kind of actions to perform:
 *      - ACTION_REMAIN: Nothing is done: no deletion, no update; quiz attempts remain related to each user.
 *      - ACTION_RENUMBER: Moves attempts from old user to be the first attempts of the new user.
 *        Quiz operations are performed to normalize this new scenario.
 *      - ACTION_DELETE_FROM_SOURCE: Deletes quiz_attempts records from the old user attempts.
 *        This means that the attemps to have into account will be only the last ones (those made
 *        with the new user). Behavior suggested by John Hoopes (well, John proposed do nothing
 *        with those attempts, leaving them related to the old user; we ).
 *      - ACTION_DELETE_FROM_TARGET: Deletes quiz_attempts records from the new user attempts.
 *        This means that the old user's attempts are leaved, and removed those from the new user
 *        as if the new user was cheating. Behaviour suggested by Nicolas Dunand.
