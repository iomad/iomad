/**
 * This interface introduces the concept of table merger: a tool for merging
 * records of the given users to merge.
 *
 * The lifecycle will be:
 *
 * 1. IomadMergeTool will call to TableMerger.getTablesToSkip(), to get the list
 *    of tables not being processed by others TableMergers. This step is done
 *    only once in the configuration phase of the IomadMergeTool.
 * 2. IomadMergeTool calls to the TableMerger.merge() to actually merge records of
 *    the given $tablename. This call will update when necessary the list of
 *    errors (on $errorMessages) and the list of actions performed (on
 *    $actionLog).
 *
 * The goal of the TableMerger.getTablesToSkip() is to exclude from processing
 * specific tables under the control of the current TableMerger.
 *
 * Example: Suppose that this TableMerger is related to table1, and also
 * to table1_aux, having a direct relation between them. Suppose that
 * this relation makes that actions done in table1 makes certain changes on
 * table1_aux. Therefore, this TableMerger can be implemented as follows:
 *
 * a. getTablesToSkip() returns an array('table1_aux') to exclude that table from bein processed
 *    by any other TableMerger.
 * b. The invokation to merge('table1',...) processes both tables, table1 and
 *    table1_aux according to some specific rules.
 *
