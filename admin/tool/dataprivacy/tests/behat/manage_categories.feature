    And I press "Add category"
    And I set the field "Name" to "Category 1"
    And I set the field "Description" to "Category 1 description"
    When I press "Save"
    Then I should see "Category 1" in the "List of data categories" "table"
    And I should see "Category 1 description" in the "Category 1" "table_row"
