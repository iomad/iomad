This files describes API changes in the logstore_database code.

=== 3.4 ===
* PostgreSQL connections now use advanced options to reduce connection overhead.  These options are not compatible
  with some connection poolers.  The dbhandlesoptions parameter has been added to allow the database to configure the
  required defaults. The parameters that are required in the database are;
    ALTER DATABASE moodle SET client_encoding = UTF8;
    ALTER DATABASE moodle SET standard_conforming_strings = on;
    ALTER DATABASE moodle SET search_path = 'moodle,public';  -- Optional, if you wish to use a custom schema.
  You can set these options against the database or the moodle user who connects.
