Feature: Forms manipulation
  In order to interact with Moodle
  As a user
  I need to set forms values

  @javascript
  Scenario: Basic forms manipulation
    Given I log in as "admin"
    And I open my profile in edit mode
    When I set the field "First name" to "Field value"
    And I set the field "Select a country" to "Japan"
    And I set the field "New password" to "TestPass"
    Then the field "First name" matches value "Field value"
    And the "Select a country" select box should contain "Japan"
    And the field "New password" matches value "TestPass"
    And I take focus off "Update profile" "button"
    And I press "Update profile"

  @javascript
  Scenario: Expand all fieldsets and advanced elements
    Given the following "courses" exist:
      | fullname | shortname | category |
      | Course 1 | C1 | 0 |
    And I log in as "admin"
    And I am on "Course 1" course homepage with editing mode on
    And I add a "Quiz" to section "1"
    When I expand all fieldsets
    Then I should see "Close the quiz"
    And I should see "Group mode"
    And I should see "Grouping"
    And I should not see "Show more..." in the "region-main" "region"
    And I should see "Show less..."
