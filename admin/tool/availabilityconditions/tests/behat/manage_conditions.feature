Feature: Manage availability conditions
  In order to control availability restrictions
  As an administrator
  I need to see the list of restrictions and hide or show them

  @javascript
  Scenario: Display list of availability conditions
    # Check the report doesn't show when not enabled.
    Given I log in as "admin"
    And I press "Customise this page"
    And I add the "Administration" block if not present
    And the following config values are set as admin:
      | enableavailability | 0 |
    And I expand "Site administration" node
    When I expand "Plugins" node
    Then I should not see "Availability restrictions"

    # Enable it and check I can now see and click on it.
    And the following config values are set as admin:
      | enableavailability | 1 |
    And I am on homepage
    And I navigate to "Manage restrictions" node in "Site administration > Plugins > Availability restrictions"

    # Having clicked on it, I should also see the list of plugins.
    And I should see "Restriction by date"
    And I should see "Restriction by grades"

    # Get to the right page

    And I log in as "admin"
    And I am on site homepage
    When I navigate to "Manage restrictions" node in "Site administration > Plugins > Availability restrictions"

    # Check the icon is there (it should be a Hide icon, meaning is currently visible).
    Then "Hide" "icon" should exist in the "Restriction by date" "table_row"

    # Click the icon. It should toggle to hidden (title=Show).
    And I click on "Hide" "icon" in the "Restriction by date" "table_row"
    And "Show" "icon" should exist in the "Restriction by date" "table_row"

    # Toggle it back to visible (title=Hide).

    And "Hide" "icon" should exist in the "Restriction by date" "table_row"

    # OK, toggling works. Set the grade one to Hide and we'll go see if it actually worked.
    And I click on "Hide" "icon" in the "Restriction by grade" "table_row"
