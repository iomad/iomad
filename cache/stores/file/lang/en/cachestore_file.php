Enabling this will speed up file interactions but comes at the cost of increased risk of hitting file system limitations.<br />
It is advisable to only turn this on if the following is true:<br />
  - If you know the number of items in the cache is going to be small enough that it won\'t cause issues on the file system you are running with.<br />
  - The data being cached is not expensive to generate. If it is then sticking with the default may still be the better option as it reduces the chance of issues.';

 * This is is like the file store, but designed for siutations where:
 *   - many more things are likely to be stored in the cache, so CRC hashing is
 *     too likely to give collisions, and storing everything in a completely flat
 *     directory structure is inadvisable.
 *   - the things we are caching are more expensive to calculate, so the extra
 *     time to computer a better hash is a worthwhile trade-off.
