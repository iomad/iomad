Feature: Set the site home page and dashboard as the default home page
  In order to set a page as my default home page
  As a user
  I need to go to the page I want and set it as my home page

  Background:
    Given the following "courses" exist:
      | fullname | shortname | category | groupmode |
      | Course 1 | C1 | 0 | 1 |
    # TODO MDL-57208 this functionality does not work without administration block.
    And I log in as "admin"
    And I am on site homepage
    And I turn editing mode on
    And I add the "Administration" block if not present
    And I configure the "Administration" block
    And I set the following fields to these values:
      | Page contexts | Display throughout the entire site |
    And I press "Save changes"
    And I log out

  Scenario: Admin sets the site page and then the dashboard as the default home page
    Given I log in as "admin"
    And I navigate to "Appearance > Navigation" in site administration
    And I set the field "Default home page for users" to "User preference"
    And I press "Save changes"
    And I am on site homepage
    And I follow "Make this my default home page"
    And I should not see "Make this my default home page"
    And I am on "Course 1" course homepage
    And "Home" "text" should exist in the ".breadcrumb-nav" "css_element"
