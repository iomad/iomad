CA Certificates for cURL library
================================

The file cacert.pem can be downloaded from http://curl.haxx.se/docs/caextract.html
or created directly from http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla/source/security/nss/lib/ckfw/builtins/certdata.txt
using mk-ca-bundle conversion tool.

The file is licensed under the same licenses as the Mozilla source file:
MPL 1.1, GPL v2.0 or LGPL 2.1

This file is by default used in all Windows installations that do not have
any "curl.cainfo =" specified in php.ini

It is also possible to force using of arbitrary CA bundle by putting it
into $CFG->dataroot/moodleorgca.crt, this may be useful especially on
non-windows servers with outdated system certificates.
