/**
 * Postgres advisory locking factory.
 *
 * Postgres locking implementation using advisory locks. Some important points. Postgres has
 * 2 different forms of lock functions, some accepting a single int, and some accepting 2 ints. This implementation
 * uses the 2 int version so that it uses a separate namespace from the session locking. The second note,
 * is because postgres uses integer keys for locks, we first need to map strings to a unique integer. This is
 * done by storing the strings in the lock_db table and using the auto-id returned. There is a static cache for
 * id's in this function.
