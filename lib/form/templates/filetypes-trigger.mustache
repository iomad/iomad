    @template core_form/filetypes-trigger

    Renders the button to open the file types browser element.

    This template uses <input> element of the type "button" as that one seems
    to be well styled by default (especially when compared to alternatives like
    <button> that are not aligned nicely with the input field.

    Classes required for JS:
    * none

    Data attributes required for JS:
    * filetypeswidget - set to "browsertrigger" to mark the actual clickable element

    Context variables required for this template:
    * none

    Example context (json):
    {
    }
}}
<input type="button" class="btn btn-secondary" data-filetypeswidget="browsertrigger" value="{{#str}} choose, core {{/str}}" />
