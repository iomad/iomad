If you have any questions (no matter how dumb), please send me an IM.  I enjoy
helping people with my code.


Requirements
================================================================================
* PHP 5.x
* SSL Support Compiled

History
================================================================================
Carlo Zottmann handed me maintenance of Class.Jabber.PHP years and years ago
(2003?).  While I did fix some bugs, I never did much with it.  I promised many
people that it would return as a PHP5 rewrite.  That day has finally come.

This code is based on my experience with Class.Jabber.PHP, but more closely
related to my Python library, SleekXMPP (http://code.google.com/p/sleekxmpp).

Documentation
================================================================================
For now, look at the examples.  In the near future, I'll have better
documentation on the website.

TODO
================================================================================
* Documentation
* MUC Support

License Exception
===============================================================================
Please contact Nathan Fritz for library exceptions if you would like to
distribute XMPPHP with a non-GPL compatible license.

Also, if you would like to distribute XMPPHP as part of a commercial package,
I sell commercial licenses.
