Description of XHProf 0.9.4 library/viewer import into Moodle

Removed (commit #1):
 * .arcconfig - Definitions for arcanist/phabricator removed completely
 * composer.json - Composer's definition removed completely
 * examples - examples dir removed completely
 * extension - extension dir removed completely
 * package.xml - PECL package definition removed completely
 * xhprof_html/docs - documentation dir removed completely

Added (commit #2 - always taken from current moodle.git master):
 * index.html - prevent directory browsing on misconfigured servers
 * xhprof_moodle.php - containing all the stuff needed to run the xhprof profiler within Moodle
 * readme_moodle.txt - this file ;-)

Our changes:  Look for "moodle" in code (commit #3 - always mimic from current moodle.git master):
 * xhprof_html/index.php  ----|
 * xhprof_html/callgraph.php -|=> Changed to use own DB iXHProfRuns implementation (moodle_xhprofrun)
 * xhprof_html/typeahead.php -|
 * xhprof_html/css/xhprof.css: Minor tweaks to report styles
 * xhprof_lib/utils/callgraph_utils.php: Modified to use $CFG->pathtodot
 * xhprof_lib/utils/xhprof_runs.php: applied patch from https://github.com/phacility/xhprof/pull/99

TODO:
 * improvements to the listing mode: various commodity details like:
       - allow to filter by various criteria
       - inline (and ajax) editing of reference/comment and deleting
       - whatever daily usage discovers ;-)
 * add new settings to control if we want to profile things like:
       - php functions
       - memory
       - cpu times
       (all them are right now enabled for everybody by default)
 * allow multiple runs to be exported together (right now only ONE can be
   exported at a time). Note it is only an UI restriction, backend supports multiple.
