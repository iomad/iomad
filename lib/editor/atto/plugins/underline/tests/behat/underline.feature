    Given I log in as "admin"
    And I open my profile in edit mode
    And I set the field "Description" to "Deprecated HTML Tag"
    And I select the text in the "Description" Atto editor
    And I click on "Show more buttons" "button"
    When I click on "Underline" "button"
    And I press "Update profile"

    Then I should see "<u>Deprecated HTML Tag</u>"
