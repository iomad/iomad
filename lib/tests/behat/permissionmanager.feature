Feature: Override permissions on a context
  In order to extend and restrict moodle features
  As an admin or a teacher
  I need to allow/deny the existing capabilities at different levels

  Background:
    Given the following "users" exist:
      | username  | firstname | lastname | email          |
      | teacher1  | Teacher   | 1        | t1@example.com |
    And the following "courses" exist:
      | fullname  | shortname |
      | Course 1  | C1        |

      | user      | course | role           |

    And I press "Student"
    Then "Add announcementsmod/forum:addnews" row "Roles with permission" column of "permissions" table should contain "Student"
