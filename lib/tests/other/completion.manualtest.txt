Completion system manual test
=============================

This text file describes a manual process which can be used to check that the
completion system is working correctly. This does not exercise every possible
element of the completion system but it covers most of the basic parts.

Site setup
----------

1) Make a fresh install of the Moodle version you are testing.

CHECK A: There is no error when installing the completion database tables.

2) Create users 'admin' (as part of install) and 'u1'
3) Set the server debug to 'Developer' so that you spot any warnings etc.
4) Create course 'CF101' (leave default except pick separate groups) and
   assign 'u1' as student


Course setup
------------

1) Create a web page resource 'w'
2) Create a forum 'f1'
3) Create a forum 'f2'
4) Create a quiz 'q1' with one question (e.g. true/false question)
5) Create a quiz 'q2' with one question (can use same question)
6) In gradebook/reports/gradebook setup, edit q2's grade (show advanced)
   to assign a 'grade to pass' of 5.0.
   [Note: Due to a bug in gradebook at time of writing, you may have to go into
   admin screens and make sure that 'Student' is included on the list of graded
   roles, or there will be an error at this step.]
7) Create 2 groups on the course. Assign u1 to one group.

Completion settings
-------------------

1) Visit the course setting screen.

CHECK B: The completion controls appear. Completion is enabled.

2) Turn off the setting (disable completion) and save.
3) Visit the admin page. Find the enablecompletion setting.

CHECK C: The enablecompletion setting appears. Completion is enabled.

4) Turn off this setting and save.

4b) Note: At present I have not found a satisfactory way to set a default
  for the config option, so if necessary, please manually tick the 'Student'
  checkbox while on this screen.

5) Visit the course setting screen again.

CHECK D: The completion controls do not appear.

6) Visit the setting screen for 'w'

CHECK E: Completion controls do not appear

7) Go to admin screen and turn completion on again, then return to the 'w' settings

CHECK F: Completion controls still do not appear

8) Go to course settings and turn completion on, then return to 'w' settings

CHECK G: Completion controls appear. Completion is set to manual.

9) Go to 'f1' settings. Set completion to automatic and to 2 discussions/replies.
10) Go to 'f2' settings. Set completion to automatic and to 'view'
11) Go to 'q1' and 'q2' settings; set both to automatic and 'grade'. Set them
  to grade based on the most recent attempt rather than 'highest'.

Completion actions
------------------

Note: Icons are subject to change, so references to a 'tick' etc might not be
correct.

1) Log in as u1 and go to CF101.

CHECK H: A completion tick (unticked) is visible next to 'w'.

2) Click the completion mark a few times.

CHECK I: Completion toggles successfully.

  2b) Go to u1's profile settings and turn on/off AJAX then repeat toggling the
      mark. Leave it ticked.
  CHECK I2: Completion still toggles successfully.

3) Visit 'f1' and post 1 message. Return to course home.

CHECK J: There is no tickmark next to f1. (If examined carefully, the 'not
  complete' icon should be present.)

4) Visit 'f1' and post a reply to the message. Return to course home.

CHECK K: There is now a tick next to f1.

5) Visit 'f2' and return to the home page.

CHECK L: There is now a tick next to f2.

6) Visit 'q1' and attempt the quiz, getting it wrong and submitting answer.
  Return to the home page.

CHECK M: There is a black 'completed' tick next to q1.

7) Visit 'q1' again and this time get it right. Return to home page.

CHECK N: There is still a black 'completed' tick next to q1.

8) Visit 'q2' and get it right. Return to home.

CHECK O: There is a green 'completed-passed' tick next to q2.

9) Visit 'q2' and get it wrong. Return to home.

CHECK P: There is a red 'completed-failed' X next to q2.

Completion progress
-------------------

1) Log in as admin again.

2) From the course admin block, click on the reports link.

CHECK Q: A 'completion progress' link appears.

3) Click on the completion progress link.

CHECK R:
  A groups dropdown should show the two groups (and 'all').
  The progress table should include all activities for which completion
    was set, across the top.
  The progress table should show u1 down the side.
  Tick and X icons should match those shown when logged in as u1.

4) Choose a group that does not include u1

CHECK S:
  An informational ('no users') message should display instead of the progress
  table.

5) Choose the group that does include u1

CHECK T:
  The progress table should show u1 again.

Backup/restore
--------------

1) Backup the course. Choose 'course users', user data for everything except
  q1 ('no user data'), and default options.

2) Restore to a new course, accepting all defaults.

3) Log in as u1 again and visit the new course.

CHECK U:
  Completion should appear as it did in the previous version of the course
  ('w','f1','f2' complete, 'q2' complete-fail) except that q1 should show as
  incomplete.
