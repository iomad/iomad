==========
Updated to version 1.4.2 (MDL-56001)
The actual code has not been updated and still reads 1.4.1, but this is tagged as 1.4.2 on the site.
My guess is that they forgot to update the numbers when tagging the new version number. An issue has
been created on their github account (https://github.com/simplepie/simplepie/issues/472).
