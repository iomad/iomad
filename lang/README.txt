Moodle Language Packs

This directory contains the standard packaged Moodle language files,
for making the Moodle interface appear in different interfaces.

The default language for Moodle is the English language, under the
Unicode scheme (UTF8).

To add more languages to Moodle, you can either:

 1) use the Moodle languages GUI in the interface to fetch
    new languages and install them in your 'dataroot' directory.

 2) download them and unzip the packs in this directory manually


For more information, see the Moodle Documentation:
