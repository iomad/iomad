This files describes API changes in /enrol/* - plugins,
information provided here is intended especially for developers.

=== 3.4 ===

* render_course_enrolment_users_table method has been removed from the renderer. The enrolled users page is now
  combined with the participants page. /enrol/users.php no longer exists.

=== 3.3 ===

* External function core_enrol_external::get_users_courses now return the user progress, start and the end course dates.

=== 3.2 ===

* External function core_enrol_external::get_users_courses now return the category id as an additional optional field.

=== 3.1 ===

* core_enrol_external::get_enrolled_users now supports two additional parameters for ordering: sortby and sortdirection.
* Enrolment plugins UI have been consolidated. Plugins can implement use_standard_editing_ui() function
  and add edit_instance_form() and edit_instance_validation() methods instead of providing their own edit.php and form.
  They can then rely on the default implementation of get_action_icons and get_course_navigation. In future this will
  mean they can be called by webservices/user upload tools because they can validate their data.

=== 3.0 ===

* Added new events enrol_instance_created, enrol_instance_updated and
  enrol_instance_deleted . Always trigger them when changing records in the
  DB table 'enrol'.
* Constant CACHE_COURSE_CONTACTS_TTL was deleted.
* External function core_enrol_external::get_enrolled_users now returns only the viewable participants if the course has groups enabled and no groupid is passed.

=== 2.9 ===

* External function core_enrol_external::get_users_courses now returns additional optional fields:
   - summary: Course summary.
   - summaryformat: Course summary format.
   - format: Course format.
   - showgrades: True if grades are shown, otherwise false.
   - lang: Forced course language.
   - enablecompletion: Control or not via completion and activity settings.

=== 2.8 ===

* enrol_plugin::instance_deleteable() is deprecated and has been replaced by enrol_plugin::can_delete_instance()
* enrol_plugin::can_hide_show_instance() is a new function to control who can hide/show enrolment instances.
  Returns true by default but plugins must implement their own logic.

=== 2.6 ===

* Enrolment plugin which supports self enrolment should implement can_self_enrol()
* Enrolment plugin should implement get_enrol_info() to expose instance information
  with webservice or external interface.
* Webservice core_enrol_get_enrolled_users_with_capability was incorrectly specifing
  float as the return type for user id. int is the actual returned type and is now
  reported as such.

=== 2.5 ===

* plugins may use general enrol/editenrolment.php page to let users edit
  enrolments manually
* new support for grade recovery in enrol_plugin::enrol_user() method

=== 2.4 ===

required changes in code:

  directly from database is not correct any more

  and ENROL_RESTORE_CLASS were removed, implement new restore_* plugin methods instead
