This files describes API changes in /mod/choice/*,
information provided here is intended especially for developers.

=== 3.3.2 ===

* choice_refresh_events() Now takes two additional parameters to refine the update to a specific instance. This function
  now optionally takes the module instance object or ID, and the course module object or ID. Please try to send the full
  objects instead of the ids to save DB calls.

=== 3.2 ===

* Events mod_choice\event\answer_submitted and mod_choice\event\answer_updated
  are no longer triggered. Observers listening to these events must instead listen
  to mod_choice\event\answer_created and mod_choice\event\answer_deleted that are
  triggered for each option that is selected or unselected. User whose choice was
  modified can be found in $event->relateduserid (this does not have to be the
  user who performs the action).

=== 3.0 ===

* External function mod_choice_external::get_choices_by_courses returned parameter "name" and
  mod_choice_external::get_choice_results "text" have been changed to PARAM_RAW.
  This is because the new external_format_string function may return raw data if the global moodlewssettingraw parameter is used.

=== 2.9 ===

* custom renderers must be updated to include action=makechoice field in display_options()
