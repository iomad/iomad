This files describes API changes in the book code.

=== 3.1 ===

* The following functions, previously used (exclusively) by upgrade steps are not available
  anymore because of the upgrade cleanup performed for this version. See MDL-51580 for more info:
    - mod_book_migrate_moddata_dir_to_legacy()
    - mod_book_migrate_all_areas()
    - mod_book_migrate_area()

=== 3.0 ===

* External function mod_book_external::get_books_by_courses returned parameter "name" has been changed to PARAM_RAW,
  this is because the new external_format_string function may return raw data if the global moodlewssettingraw parameter is used.

=== 2.7 ===

* bogus legacy log calls were removed
* \mod_book\event\chapter_deleted::set_legacy_logdata() was removed
