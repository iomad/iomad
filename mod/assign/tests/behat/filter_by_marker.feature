Feature: In an assignment, teachers can filter displayed submissions by assigned marker
  In order to manage submissions more easily
  As a teacher
  I need to view submissions allocated to markers.

    Given the following "courses" exist:

    And the following "users" exist:
      | username | firstname | lastname | email |
