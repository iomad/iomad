Feature: Regrading quiz attempts using the Grades report
  In order to be able to correct mistakes I made setting up my quiz

      | TF       | 1    | 5.0     |
      | SA       | 1    | 5.0     |
    And user "student1" has attempted "Quiz for testing regrading" with responses:
      | slot | response |
      |   1  | True     |
      |   2  | frog     |

  Scenario: Regrade all attempts
    Given I log in as "teacher"
    And I am on "Course 1" course homepage
    And I follow "Quiz for testing regrading"
    And I navigate to "Results > Grades" in current page administration
    When I press "Regrade all"

    # Note, the order is not defined, so we can only check part of the message.
    # Also, nothing has changed in the quiz, so the regrade won't alter any scores,
    # but this is still a useful test that the regrade process completes without errors.
    Then I should see "Quiz for testing regrading"
    And I should see "Successfully regraded (2/2)"
    And I should see "Regrade completed successfully"
    And I press "Continue"

    # These next tests just serve to check we got back to the report.
    And I should see "Quiz for testing regrading"
    And I should see "Overall number of students achieving grade ranges"

  Scenario: Regrade selected attempts
    Given I log in as "teacher"
    And I am on "Course 1" course homepage
    And I follow "Quiz for testing regrading"
    And I navigate to "Results > Grades" in current page administration
    When I click on "Select attempt" "checkbox" in the "Student Two" "table_row"

    And I press "Regrade selected attempts"
    Then I should see "Quiz for testing regrading"
    And I should see "Successfully regraded (1/1)"
    And I should see "Regrade completed successfully"
    And I press "Continue"

    # These next tests just serve to check we got back to the report.
    And I should see "Quiz for testing regrading"
    And I should see "Overall number of students achieving grade ranges"

  Scenario: Dry-run a full regrade, then regrade the attempts that will need it.
    Given I log in as "teacher"

    # In the following, the first number is strike-through, and the second is not, but Behat can't see that.
    # At this point, it is showing what would change.
    And "Student TwoReview attempt" row "Q. 2/50.00Sort by Q. 2/50.00 Ascending" column of "attempts" table should contain "40.00/25.00"

    And I press "Regrade attempts marked as needing regrading (1)"
    And I should see "Quiz for testing regrading"
    And I should see "Successfully regraded (1/1)"
    And I should see "Regrade completed successfully"
    And I press "Continue"

    # These next tests just serve to check we got back to the report.
    And I should see "Quiz for testing regrading"
    And I should see "Overall number of students achieving grade ranges"
    # Now, both old-score strike-through and new score plain, are still shown, but now it indicates what did change.
    And "Student TwoReview attempt" row "Q. 2/50.00Sort by Q. 2/50.00 Ascending" column of "attempts" table should contain "40.00/25.00"
