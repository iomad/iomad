  @javascript
  Scenario: Report works when there are no attempts
    When I am on the "Quiz 1" "mod_quiz > Responses report" page logged in as teacher
    Then I should see "Attempts: 0"
    And I should see "Nothing to display"
    And I set the field "Attempts from" to "enrolled users who have not attempted the quiz"

  @javascript
  Scenario: Report works when there are attempts
    Given user "student1" has started an attempt at quiz "Quiz 1"
    And user "student1" has checked answers in their attempt at quiz "Quiz 1":
      | slot | response |
      |   1  | 1.0      |
    And user "student1" has checked answers in their attempt at quiz "Quiz 1":
      | slot | response |
      |   1  | 3.0      |
    And user "student1" has checked answers in their attempt at quiz "Quiz 1":
      | slot | response |
      |   1  | 3.14     |
    And user "student1" has finished an attempt at quiz "Quiz 1"

    When I am on the "Quiz 1" "mod_quiz > Responses report" page logged in as teacher
    Then I should see "Attempts: 1"
    And I should see "Student One"
    And I should not see "Student Two"
    And I set the field "Attempts from" to "enrolled users who have, or have not, attempted the quiz"
    And I set the field "Which tries" to "All tries"
    And I should see "Response 1a"
    And I press "Show report"
    And "Student OneReview attempt" row "Response 1aSort by Response 1a Ascending" column of "responses" table should contain "1.0"
    And "Student OneReview attempt" row "State" column of "responses" table should contain ""
    And "Finished" row "Grade/100.00Sort by Grade/100.00 Ascending" column of "responses" table should contain "33.33"
    And "Finished" row "Response 1aSort by Response 1a Ascending" column of "responses" table should contain "3.14"
    And "Student Two" row "State" column of "responses" table should contain "-"
    And "Student Two" row "Response 1aSort by Response 1a Ascending" column of "responses" table should contain "-"

  @javascript
  Scenario: Report does not allow strange combinations of options
    Given I am on the "Quiz 1" "mod_quiz > Responses report" page logged in as teacher
    And the "Which tries" "select" should be enabled
    When I set the field "Attempts from" to "enrolled users who have not attempted the quiz"
    Then the "Which tries" "select" should be disabled
