  Scenario: Validating the marking of an essay question attempt.
    When I follow "Make comment or override mark"
    And I switch to "commentquestion" window
    And I set the field "Mark" to "25"
    And I press "Save"
    Then I should see "This grade is outside the valid range."
    And I set the field "Mark" to "aa"
    And I press "Save"
    And I should see "That is not a valid number."
    And I set the field "Mark" to "10.0"
    And I press "Save" and switch to main window
    And I should see "Complete" in the "Manually graded 10 with comment: " "table_row"
    # This time is same as time the window is open. So wait for it to close before proceeding.
    And I wait "2" seconds
