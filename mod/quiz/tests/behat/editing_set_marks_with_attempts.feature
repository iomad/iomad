  @javascript
  Scenario: Set the max mark for a question.
    When I set the max mark for question "First question" to "7.0"
    Then I should see "7.00"
    And I should see "3.00"
    And I should see "Total of marks: 10.00"

    When I follow "Edit maximum mark"
    And I wait until "li input[name=maxmark]" "css_element" exists
    And I take focus off "li input[name=maxmark]" "css_element"
    Then I should see "7.00"
    And I should see "3.00"
    And I should see "Total of marks: 10.00"
    And "li input[name=maxmark]" "css_element" should not exist

  @javascript
  Scenario: Set the overall Maximum grade.
    When I set the field "maxgrade" to "10.0"
    And I press "savechanges"
    Then the field "maxgrade" matches value "10.00"
    And I should see "2.00"
    And I should see "3.00"
    And I should see "Total of marks: 5.00"

  @javascript
  Scenario: Verify the number of decimal places shown is what the quiz settings say it should be.
    # Then the field "maxgrade" matches value "20.00" -- with exact match on decimal places.
    Then "//input[@name = 'maxgrade' and @value = '20.00']" "xpath_element" should exist
    And I should see "2.00"
    And I should see "3.00"
    And I should see "Total of marks: 5.00"
    And I should not see "2.000"
    And I should not see "3.000"
    And I should not see "Total of marks: 5.000"
    And I follow "Quiz 1"
    When I navigate to "Edit settings" in current page administration
    And I set the following fields to these values:
      | Decimal places in grades | 3 |
      | Decimal places in question grades | 5 |
    And I press "Save and display"
    And I navigate to "Edit quiz" in current page administration
    # Then the field "maxgrade" matches value "20.000" -- with exact match on decimal places.
    Then "//input[@name = 'maxgrade' and @value = '20.000']" "xpath_element" should exist
    And I should see "2.00000"
    And I should see "3.00000"
    And I should see "Total of marks: 5.000"
    And I should not see "2.000000"
    And I should not see "3.000000"
    And I should not see "Total of marks: 5.0000"
