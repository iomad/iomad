Feature: Set a quiz to be marked complete when the student uses all attempts allowed
  In order to ensure a student has learned the material before being marked complete
  As a teacher
  I need to set a quiz to complete when the student receives a passing grade, or completed_fail if they use all attempts without passing

  Background:
    Given the following "users" exist:
      | username | firstname | lastname | email                |

    And I set the field "False" to "1"
    And I press "Finish attempt ..."
    And I press "Submit all and finish"
    And I am on "Course 1" course homepage
    And the "Test quiz name" "quiz" activity with "auto" completion should be marked as not complete
    And I follow "Test quiz name"
    And I press "Re-attempt quiz"
    And I set the field "False" to "1"
    And I press "Finish attempt ..."
    And I press "Submit all and finish"
    And I am on "Course 1" course homepage
    Then "Completed: Test quiz name" "icon" should exist in the "li.modtype_quiz" "css_element"
