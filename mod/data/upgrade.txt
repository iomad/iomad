This files describes API changes in /mod/data - plugins,
information provided here is intended especially for developers.

=== 3.4 ===
* External function mod_data_external::search_entries() now returns the maxcount field: Total count of records that the user could
    see in the database (if all the search criterias were removed).
* External function get_entry now returns an additional field "ratinginfo" containing the entry rating information.

=== 3.3.2 ===
* data_refresh_events() Now takes two additional parameters to refine the update to a specific instance. This function
  now optionally takes the module instance object or ID, and the course module object or ID. Please try to send the full
  objects instead of the ids to save DB calls.

=== 3.3 ===

* External function get_databases_by_courses now return more fields for users with mod/data:viewentry capability enabled:
    maxentries, rssarticles, singletemplate, listtemplate, listtemplateheader, listtemplatefooter, addtemplate,
    rsstemplate, rsstitletemplate, csstemplate, jstemplate, asearchtemplate, approval, defaultsort, defaultsortdir, manageapproved.
* Data field classes extending data_field_base should implement the get_config_for_external method.
    This method is used for returning the field settings for external functions.
    You should check the user capabilities of the current user before returning any field setting value.
    This is intended to protect field settings like private keys for external systems.
* Required entries has been added to the Activity completion setting of mod_form. Entries required for completion
    (in the entries section) is no longer displayed for new instances and will be deprecated in a future release
    in favour of the new completion setting.

=== 3.2 ===

* New hook - update_content_import - Can be implemented by field subplugins data_field_* class
    This can be used to pre-process data from a csv file before it is inserted into the database.
