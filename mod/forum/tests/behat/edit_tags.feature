Feature: Edited forum posts handle tags correctly
  In order to get forum posts properly labelled
  As a user
  I need to introduce the tags while editing

  Background:
    Given the following "users" exist:
      | username | firstname | lastname | email |
      | teacher1 | Teacher | 1 | teacher1@example.com |
      | student1 | Student | 1 | student1@example.com |
    And the following "courses" exist:
      | fullname | shortname | format |
      | Course 1 | C1 | topics |
    And the following "course enrolments" exist:
      | user | course | role |
      | teacher1 | C1 | editingteacher |
      | student1 | C1 | student |
    And I log in as "teacher1"
    And I am on "Course 1" course homepage with editing mode on
    And I add a "Forum" to section "1" and I fill the form with:
      | Forum name | Test forum name |
      | Description | Test forum description |
    And I add a new discussion to "Test forum name" forum with:
      | Subject | Teacher post subject |
      | Message | Teacher post message |
    And I log out

  @javascript
  Scenario: Forum post edition of custom tags works as expected
    Given I log in as "student1"
    And I am on "Course 1" course homepage
    And I reply "Teacher post subject" post from "Test forum name" forum with:
      | Subject | Student post subject |
      | Message | Student post message |
      | Tags    | Tag1                 |
    Then I should see "Tag1" in the ".forum-tags" "css_element"
    And I click on "Edit" "link" in the "//div[@aria-label='Student post subject by Student 1']" "xpath_element"
    Then I should see "Tag1" in the ".form-autocomplete-selection" "css_element"

  @javascript
  Scenario: Forum post edition of standard tags works as expected
    Given I log in as "admin"
    And I navigate to "Appearance > Manage tags" in site administration
    And I follow "Default collection"
    And I follow "Add standard tags"
    And I set the field "Enter comma-separated list of new tags" to "OT1, OT2, OT3"
    And I press "Continue"
    And I log out
    And I log in as "teacher1"
    And I am on "Course 1" course homepage
    And I follow "Test forum"
    And I click on "Add a new discussion topic" "button"
    And I expand all fieldsets
    And I open the autocomplete suggestions list
    And I should see "OT1" in the ".form-autocomplete-suggestions" "css_element"
    And I should see "OT2" in the ".form-autocomplete-suggestions" "css_element"
    And I should see "OT3" in the ".form-autocomplete-suggestions" "css_element"
    And I reply "Teacher post subject" post from "Test forum name" forum with:
      | Subject | Student post subject |
      | Message | Student post message |
      | Tags | OT1, OT3 |
    Then I should see "OT1" in the ".forum-tags" "css_element"
    And I should see "OT3" in the ".forum-tags" "css_element"
    And I should not see "OT2" in the ".forum-tags" "css_element"
    And I click on "Edit" "link" in the "//div[@aria-label='Student post subject by Teacher 1']" "xpath_element"
    And I should see "OT1" in the ".form-autocomplete-selection" "css_element"
    And I should see "OT3" in the ".form-autocomplete-selection" "css_element"
    And I should not see "OT2" in the ".form-autocomplete-selection" "css_element"
