    And the following "course enrolments" exist:
      | user | course | role |
      | student1 | C1 | student |
    And I log in as "admin"
    And the following config values are set as admin:
      | forum_enabletimedposts | 1 |
    And I am on "Course 1" course homepage with editing mode on
    And I add a "Forum" to section "1" and I fill the form with:
      | Forum name | Test forum name |
      | Description | Test forum description |
    And I add a new discussion to "Test forum name" forum with:
      | Subject | Discussion 1 |
      | Message | Discussion contents 1, first message |
    And I add a new discussion to "Test forum name" forum with:

    And I add a new discussion to "Test forum name" forum with:

      | Message            | Discussion contents 3, first message |

    And I am on "Course 1" course homepage
    And I follow "Test forum name"
    And I should see "Discussion 2 timed"
    And I should see "Discussion 3 timed"
    And ".timedpost" "css_element" should exist
    And I log out
    And I log in as "student1"

    And I follow "Test forum name"
    Then I should see "Discussion 1"
    And I should not see "Discussion 2 timed"
    And ".timedpost" "css_element" should not exist
    And I should see "Discussion 3 timed"
