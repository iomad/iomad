     forum_tp_count_discussion_read_records

     forum_tp_count_forum_posts
     forum_tp_count_forum_read_records

   * forum_subscribe
   * forum_unsubscribe
   * forum_subscribed_users
   * forum_is_forcesubscribed
   * forum_forcesubscribe
   * forum_get_forcesubscribed
   * forum_get_subscribed_forums
   * forum_get_optional_subscribed_forums
   * forum_get_potential_subscribers
 * External function mod_forum_external::get_forum_discussions has been deprecated.
   Use mod_forum_external::get_forum_discussions_paginated instead.

=== 2.6 ===

* The file post_form.php should not be included, the class it contained has
  been moved so that it can benefit from autoloading.
* The function forum_shorten_post() has been deprecated. It was doing a poor
  job of shortening forum post text and the shorten_text() function does a
  much better job.
* The constant FORUM_TRACKING_ON has been deprecated and replaced by
  FORUM_TRACKING_FORCED. The value between them is maintained, so they are
  interchangeable, but code should migrate to the new name.

=== 2.5 ===

The function forum_check_throttling has been changed so that a warning object is returned when a user has reached the 'Post threshold for warning' or
'Post threshold for blocking' setting, rather than echoing this on screen. This allows the warning to be moved inside the post form as it can be added
as a HTML element, where it is more noticeable. False is returned if there is no need to warn, or restrict the user from posting - see MDL-39182.

=== 2.3.5, 2.4.2 ===

* mod/forum:allowforcesubscribe capability will be forcefully assigned to frontpage role, as it was mistakenly missed off
when the capability was initially created. If you don't want users with frontpage role to get forum (with forcesubscribe) emails,
then please remove this capability for frontpage role.
