  Scenario: See users who have not responded
    # Set up a feedback.
    When I log in as "teacher1"
    And I am on "Course 1" course homepage with editing mode on
    And I add a "Feedback" to section "1" and I fill the form with:
      | Name                | Frogs                                             |
      | Description         | x                                                 |
      | Record user names   | User's name will be logged and shown with answers |
      | Access restrictions | Grouping: GX1                                     |
    And I follow "Frogs"
    And I click on "Edit questions" "link" in the "[role=main]" "css_element"
    And I set the field "Add question" to "Short text answer"
    And I set the following fields to these values:
      | Question | Y/N? |
    And I press "Save question"
    And I log out

    # Go in as student 1 and do the feedback.
    And I log in as "student1"
    And I am on "Course 1" course homepage
    And I follow "Frogs"
    And I follow "Answer the questions"
    And I set the field "Y/N?" to "Y"
    And I press "Submit your answers"
    And I log out

    # Go in as teacher and check the users who haven't completed it.
    And I log in as "teacher1"
    And I am on "Course 1" course homepage
    And I follow "Frogs"
    And I navigate to "Show non-respondents" in current page administration

    # Should only show student 2; not student 1 (they did it) or 3 (not in grouping).
    Then I should see "Student 2"
    And I should not see "Student 1"
    And I should not see "Student 3"
