This files describes API changes in the mod_scorm code.

=== 3.3.2 ===

* scorm_refresh_events() Now takes two additional parameters to refine the update to a specific instance. This function
  now optionally takes the module instance object or ID, and the course module object or ID. Please try to send the full
  objects instead of the ids to save DB calls.

=== 3.1 ===
* Group and groupings support has now been enabled.

=== 3.0 ===

* External function mod_scorm_external::get_scorms_by_courses returned parameter "name" has been changed to PARAM_RAW,
  this is because the new external_format_string function may return raw data if the global moodlewssettingraw parameter is used.
* Function scorm_view_display was renamed to scorm_print_launch to avoid
  confussion with new function scorm_view.

=== 2.8 ===

* Coding style fixes. A large number of coding style issues were fixed in MDL-45887. This means any local modifications
 to mod_scorm are likely to conflict.

* All scorm report plugins should use namespaced classnames now. Refer MDL-46469 for details.
