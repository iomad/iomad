      | Name | Runtime Basic Calls SCORM 2004 3rd Edition package |
      | Description | Description |
    And I upload "mod/scorm/tests/packages/RuntimeBasicCalls_SCORM20043rdEdition.zip" file to "Package file" filemanager
    And I click on "Save and display" "button"
    And I should see "Runtime Basic Calls SCORM 2004 3rd Edition package"
    And I log out
    When I log in as "student1"
    And I am on "Course 1" course homepage
    And I follow "Runtime Basic Calls SCORM 2004 3rd Edition package"
    Then I should see "Normal"
    And I press "Enter"
    And I switch to "scorm_object" iframe
    And I press "Next"
    And I press "Next"
    And I switch to "contentFrame" iframe
    And I should see "Scoring"
    And I switch to the main frame

    And I switch to "scorm_object" iframe
    And I switch to "contentFrame" iframe
