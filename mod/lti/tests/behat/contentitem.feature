Feature: Content-Item support
  In order to easily add activities and content in a course from an external tool
  As a teacher
  I need to utilise a tool that supports the Content-Item Message type

  Background:
    Given the following "users" exist:
      | username | firstname | lastname | email                |
      | teacher1 | Terry1    | Teacher1 | teacher1@example.com |
    And the following "courses" exist:
      | fullname | shortname | category |
      | Course 1 | C1 | 0 |
    And the following "course enrolments" exist:
      | user | course | role |
      | teacher1 | C1 | editingteacher |
    And I log in as "admin"
    And I navigate to "Manage tools" node in "Site administration > Plugins > Activity modules > External tool"
    # Create tool type that supports content-item.
    And I follow "configure a tool manually"
