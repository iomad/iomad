 * This file keeps track of upgrades to the navigation block

 * The upgrade function in this file will attempt to perform all the necessary

 *
 * If there's something it cannot do itself, it will tell you what you need to do.
 *
 * The commands in here will all be database-neutral, using the methods of
 * database_manager class

 * Please do not forget to use upgrade_set_timeout()
 * before any action that may take longer time to finish.

 *
 * There were several reasons that they were put there and not here, both becuase
 * the process for the two blocks was very similar and because the upgrade process
 * was complex due to us wanting to remvoe the outmoded blocks that this
