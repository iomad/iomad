    # Admin needs to enable portfolio API and set a portfolio instance first.
    And I log in as "admin"
    And the following config values are set as admin:

    # Teacher sets up assessment form and changes the phase to submission.
    And I log in as "teacher1"
    And I am on "Course1" course homepage
    And I edit assessment form in workshop "TestWorkshop" as:"
      | id_description__idx_0_editor | Aspect1 |
