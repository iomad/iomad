Feature: edit_availability
  In order to control which students can see activities
  As a teacher
  I need to set up availability options for activities and sections

  # PURPOSE OF THIS TEST FEATURE:
  #
  # This test covers the user interface around editing availability conditions,
  # especially the JavaScript code which is not tested elsewhere (e.g. does the
  # 'Add restriction' dialog work). It tests both forms and also the admin
  # setting interface.
  #
  # This test does not check the detailed behaviour of the availability system,
  # which is mainly covered in PHPUnit (and, from the user interface
  # perspective, in the other Behat tests for each type of condition).

  Background:
    Given the following "courses" exist:
      | fullname | shortname | format |
      | Course 1 | C1        | topics |
    And the following "users" exist:
      | username |
      | teacher1 |
      | student1 |
    And the following "course enrolments" exist:
      | user     | course | role           |
      | teacher1 | C1     | editingteacher |
      | student1 | C1     | student        |

  Scenario: Confirm the 'enable availability' option is working
    Given the following config values are set as admin:
      | enableavailability | 0 |
    When I log in as "teacher1"
    And I am on "Course 1" course homepage with editing mode on
    And I add a "Page" to section "1"
    Then "Restrict access" "fieldset" should not exist

    Given I am on "Course 1" course homepage
    When I edit the section "1"
    Then "Restrict access" "fieldset" should not exist

    And the following config values are set as admin:
      | enableavailability | 1 |
