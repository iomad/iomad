This files describes API changes in /availability/*.

The information here is intended only for developers.

=== 3.2 ===

* Condition plugins must replace the CSS selector "#fitem_id_availabilityconditionsjson" with ".availability-field".
  This selector is often used in your plugin's yui/src/form/js/form.js file.

=== 2.9 ===

* Condition plugins can now implement a new include_after_restore function to
  indicate that they should be removed during the restore process. (This is
  implemented so that group and grouping conditions are removed if groups are
  not restored.)

=== 2.8 ===

* There is a new API function in the info_module/info_section objects (and
  related functions in internal API): get_user_list_sql. This returns SQL code
  that does roughly the same as filter_user_list to return a list of users who
  should be shown as having access to the module or section.

* Any third-party availability plugins which return true to
  is_applied_to_user_lists (and therefore previously implemented
  filter_user_list) should now also implement get_user_list_sql. If not
  implemented, a debugging warning will occur when anybody calls
  get_user_list_sql if the affected plugin is in use, and that user list will
  not be filtered by the plugin.
