 *
 * The structure of a condition in JSON input data is:
 *
 * { type:'date', ... }
 *
 * where 'date' is the name of the plugin (availability_date in this case) and
 * ... is arbitrary extra data to be used by the plugin.
 *
 * Conditions require a constructor with one parameter: $structure. This will
 * contain all the JSON data for the condition. If the structure of the data
 * is incorrect (e.g. missing fields) then the constructor may throw a
 * coding_exception. However, the constructor should cope with all data that
 * was previously valid (e.g. if the format changes, old data may still be
 * present in a restore, so there should be a default value for any new fields
 * and old ones should be handled correctly).
