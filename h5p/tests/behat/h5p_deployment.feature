  @javascript
  Scenario: A student I should not be able to see a package that has been deployed by a deleted user. Then if another user deploys the package, I can see it.
    Given I am on the "H5PPage" "page activity" page logged in as student1
    And I switch to "h5p-iframe" class iframe
    And I should see "This file can't be displayed"
    And I switch to the main frame
    And I log out
    # Then teacher2 will be allowed to deploy the package.
    When I am on the "H5PPage" "page activity" page logged in as teacher2
    # Note the double switch to iframe is needed because the first iframe is the one that contains the H5P package and
    # the second iframe is the one that contains the H5P content.
    And I switch to "h5p-iframe" class iframe
    And I switch to "h5p-iframe" class iframe
    Then I should see "Of which countries are Berlin"
    And I switch to the main frame
    And I log out
    # Now student1 should be able to see the package.
    And I am on the "H5PPage" "page activity" page logged in as student1
    And I switch to "h5p-iframe" class iframe
    And I switch to "h5p-iframe" class iframe
    And I should see "Of which countries are Berlin"
