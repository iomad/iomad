  In order to remove customisations from dashboard page
  As a user
  I need to reset dashboard page

  Background:
    Given the following "users" exist:
      | username | firstname | lastname | email |
      | student1 | Student | 1 | student1@example.com |
      | student2 | Student | 2 | student2@example.com |
    And the following "courses" exist:

  Scenario: Add blocks to page and reset
    When I press "Customise this page"
    And I add the "Latest announcements" block
    And I add the "Comments" block
    And I press "Reset page to default"
    Then I should not see "Latest announcements"
    And I should see "Latest badges"
    And I should see "Calendar"
    And I should see "Upcoming events"
    And I should not see "Comments"
    And I should not see "Reset page to default"
